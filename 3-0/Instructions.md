# Challenge - Tree Printing (Java or Python)

The challenge is to print out locations in a tree-like structre on the screen.
A location can contain from 0 to many child locations.
Locations at all levels should be printed to the screen using indenting.

Your function should be able to deal with any number of levels and not just those being printed out (for example you should be able to add Europe containing UK and it should still print everything out correctly).

There is no validation carried out once complete so you will need to "mark your own homework".

This challenge is both in Java and Python, please see the relevant steps below.

## Java Steps:
- First run __/JavaApp/App.java__ to see an example of what should be printed out.
- Edit the __Print.java__ file, the PrintOutTree method is called during execution, you may create other methods as you wish.
- Execute __/JavaApp/App.java__ again and check if you have printed the whole tree (there are 10 locations in total which should be printed at differing levels).

## Python Steps:
- First run __/Python/app.py__ to see an example of what should be printed out.
- Edit the __Print.py__ file, the printTree method is called during execution, you may create other methods as you wish.
- Execute __/Python/app.py__ again and check if you have printed the whole tree (there are 10 locations in total which should be printed at differing levels).


__Good luck and happy coding!__
