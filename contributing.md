# Contributing
If you would like to contribute to the challenges please follow the steps below:
- Create a new branch from **main**
- Update the [README.md](READEME.md) file claiming the next number under the challenges heading. Please use the next major number (Major-Minor), if you would like to split your challenge into parts you can also then use the minor number.
- Immediately commit, push your branch and create a PR, this is to make sure that your number is reserved for use and will not clash with anyone else creating a challenge. Note if you to clash your PR will be rejected.

- Using the same branch create a new folder in the format of Major-Minor (e.g. 2-0).
- Add a **instructions.md** file [help using markdown files can be found here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
- Add a **help.md** file containing additional help for your challenge in case the user gets stuck.
- Create any other folders and files within your own challenge folder.
- Push changes from your branch.
- Create a new PR from your branch to main.
- Assuming you have followed all the above your branch will be reviewed and approved, if any of the above are missing your change will be rejected with a comment as to why.
